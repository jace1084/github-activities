<!Doctype html>
<html>
    <head>
        <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style-05.css">
    </head>
    <body>

    </body>
</html>

<!-- "link" will link the html back to the proper css file in the href=folder
When using .css href you no longer add the <style>!! Make sure the file is labeled (saved as) .css  
    
if the file is in another folder you would add  href="foldername/filename"

the proper way would be to add a css folder in the assests folder, which would contain the css file.

The same thing goes for the images!!-->
